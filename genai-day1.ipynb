He wasn't content with napping in sunbeams and chasing dust motes. Bartholomew yearned for adventure, for the unknown. He spent his days gazing out the window, watching birds flitting through the branches, their carefree lives fueling his wanderlust.\n\nOne day, a delivery truck arrived, bearing a package that smelled of faraway lands and exciting possibilities. As the delivery man placed the box on the porch, Bartholomew saw his chance. With a flick of his tail, he slipped out the open door and onto the porch. The man, oblivious, went on his way, leaving Bartholomew alone with the tempting box.\n\nSniffing cautiously, Bartholomew found a small, raggedy hole near the bottom.  He squeezed through, finding himself inside a wonderland of exotic scents and textures. He was inside a sack of coffee beans! Bartholomew burrowed deep, reveling in the rich aroma, and then, with a jolt, the sack was lifted. He was being carried!\n\nBartholomew's heart thumped. He had never been outside the yard, let alone in a car. The world rushed by, a blur of colours and sounds. He felt a thrill, a sense of exhilaration he'd never known.\n\nFinally, the car stopped, and Bartholomew was dumped onto a pile of burlap sacks. He was in a bustling market, a cacophony of smells, shouts, and music. A world unlike anything he had ever seen. \n\nBartholomew explored, his whiskers twitching with delight. He chased a runaway mango, befriended a street vendor who shared a delicious piece of fish, and even caught a glimpse of a street performer juggling oranges, his acrobatic skills inspiring Bartholomew to practice a few leaps of his own. \n\nBy nightfall, Bartholomew felt a pang of longing. He missed his comfortable bed and the familiar smell of his home. He knew he had to return. With a determined meow, he set off on his own, guided by the stars and the faintest scent of home.\n\nHe walked for what felt like hours, dodging feet and shopping carts, until a familiar aroma hit his nose. It was the scent of his human's favourite perfume. Following the scent, he found himself back in his own yard, the porch light beckoning him home. \n\nHe slipped through the open door, and there was his human, looking frantic.  She scooped him up in a hug, tears of relief streaming down her face.  \n\nBartholomew snuggled into her embrace, content and weary. His adventure had been thrilling, but he knew that true contentment lay in the familiar comfort of home. He had tasted the world, but it was the love of his human that made his life complete. And so, Bartholomew, the adventurous cat, settled down for a well-deserved nap, the taste of adventure and the warmth of home lingering on his whiskers. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        temperature=0.1,\n        top_p=1,\n        max_output_tokens=5,\n    ))\n\nzero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.
